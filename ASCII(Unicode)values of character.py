# Code snippet to calculate the value of any input character

char = input("Enter a character:")  # Take character as an input
ASCII_Value = ord(char)  # By using ord() method we calculate the ASCII(unicode) value of character
print(ASCII_Value)  # print the ASCII(unicode value) of alphabet or character
print("The ASCII(unicode) value of character is:", str(ASCII_Value))  # we can also print it like that by using str()
#  function to concatenate string and integer value....The interpreter will take the output integer as string.
